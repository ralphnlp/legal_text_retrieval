## Introduction
- Legal question answering is one of the important tasks that help many people find instructions for their difficulties in daily life. When people 
have legal situations, they look for help from legal experts, but the experts does not support them immediately. That is the motivation of the 
Vietnamese community including us to build an automatic system to answer or recommend instructions for legal situations. That does not also help 
ordinary people but experts for quickly get instructions or references for their jobs.
- This challenge focus on finding relevant legal articles that can help people answer their legal situations. In particular, given a query, which 
is a legal question or situation, the participating system must find relevant articles in a given corpus that can help answer that query.
